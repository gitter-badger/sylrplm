  # A mixin gathering the methods a workitem store participant needs.
  #
  # Two kinds of methods are involved here, the ones used by the engine
  # (its participant map) and the ones used by 'workflow clients'.
  # Thus consume() and cancel() are triggered by the engine, and
  # save() and forward() are at the disposal of 'workflow clients'.
  #
  # A 'workflow client' is supposed to use methods similar to hash methods
  # to retrieve workitems, like in
  #

  # The simplest workitem store possible, gathers the workitem in a
  # hash (this class is an extension of Hash).
  #
  # Some examples :
  #
  #   engine.register_participant(:alice, OpenWFE::HashParticipant)
  #   engine.register_participant("bob", OpenWFE::HashParticipant)
  #
  #   hp = engine.register_participant(:charly, OpenWFE::HashParticipant)
  #   #...
  #   puts "there are currently #{hp.size} workitems for Charly"
  #
  #   hp = OpenWFE::HashParticipant.new
  #   engine.register_participant("debbie", hp)
  #
  class HashParticipant < Hash
    include StoreParticipantMixin

    # that's all...
  end

  #
  # Implementation of a store participant stores the workitems in
  # yaml file in a dedicated directory.
  #
  # It's quite easy to register a YamlParticipant :
  #
  #   yp = engine.register_participant(:alex, YamlParticipant)
  #
  #   puts yp.dirname
  #
  # should yield "./work/participants/alex/" (if the key :work_directory
  # in engine.application_context is unset)
  #
  class YamlParticipant < YamlFileStorage
    include StoreParticipantMixin

    attr_accessor :dirname

    #
    # The constructor for YamlParticipant awaits a dirname and an
    # application_context.
    # The dirname should be a simple name acceptable as a filename.
    #
    def initialize (dirname, application_context)

      @dirname = OpenWFE::ensure_for_filename(dirname.to_s)

      service_name = self.class.name + '__' + @dirname

      path = '/participants/' + @dirname

      super(service_name, application_context, path)
    end

      def compute_file_path (fei)

        fei.workflow_instance_id + '__' +
        fei.workflow_definition_name + '_' +
