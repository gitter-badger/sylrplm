require 'ruote/part/local_participant'


module Ruote

  #
  # One of the simplest participants. Simply passes a workitem to a block
  # of ruby code.
  #
  #   engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem|
  #     workitem.fields['time'] = Time.now
  #   end
  #
  # This participant implicitely replies to the engine when the block execution
  # is over.
  #
  # You can pass the flow_expression (participant expression) as well.
  #
  #   engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem, flow_exp|
  #     workitem.fields['amount'] = flow_exp.lookup_variable('amount')
  #   end
  #
  #
  # == do_not_thread
  #
  # By default, this participant (like most other participants) is executed
  # in its own thread (in a Ruby runtime where EventMachine is running,
  # EM.next_tick is used instead of a new thread).
  #
  # You can change that behaviour (beware block thats monopolises the whole
  # engine !) by doing
  #
  #   alpha = engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem|
  #     workitem.fields['time'] = Time.now
  #   end
  #
  #   alpha.do_not_thread = true
  #
  # (you could also override do_not_thread, the method ...)
